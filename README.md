Step 1. Visualize the actual goals to get motivated !
---
:::success
**Action Step**

- Add at least five remote job opportunities to your job tracking sheet.
:::

- find 5 desired job from [Remote Job Boards](https://igotpassion.net/remote-job-boards/)
    - [We Work Remotely](https://weworkremotely.com)
    - [Remotive](https://remotive.io/remote-jobs)
    - [Jobspresso](https://jobspresso.co/remote-work/)
    - [Remote.co](https://remote.co/remote-jobs/) 
- Make a copy of this [job tracking sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SkgmoD30DO4wsJYDDnuWMAwNAkewV6dLcVnel1uhC7k/edit#gid=0). To make a copy, select File > Make a Copy.

Step 2. Create a two-column online resume

:::success
**Action Step**

- Sign up for [VisualCV](https://www.visualcv.com/?gspk=Um9iZXJ0R2liYg==&gsxid=72sdRH5Wn0fe&utm_medium=influencer_RobertGibb&utm_source=Growsumo) and create a one-page resume using the guidelines in the bulleted below. You can also use [my resume](https://igotpassion.net/career/resume/) for inspiration.
:::


- Here is what makes this resume more effective than traditional resumes:

    - The two-column format makes it easy for hiring managers to scan.
    - It uses testimonials from my previous managers for social proof.
    - Employer names link out to pages like this that elaborate on my experience.
    - Many accomplishments link out to live projects I’ve completed.
    - I add direct links to samples of my work.
    - **Most importantly, I focus on end results rather than soft skills**.:star:

- [traditional CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6BahD3pAp2yRWhUdmZRNjFFbHc/view) V.S [the resume author use today](https://igotpassion.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/robert-gibb-resume-new.pdf) 

    traditional CV is plain and didn’t properly showcase the accomplishments and personality
    
- company email
- skills 更新
    
    
Step 3. Create an idea-first cover letter
---

:::success
**Action Step**

- Apply to some remote jobs you added to your job tracking sheet using this [idea-first cover letter template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1we_W7fV67GWQUVwAVEMUMizRmrOqzjmgWTngJGqzoPA/edit#heading=h.vuonta7540ag).
:::

- This type of cover letter leads with original, specific ideas about **how you’d improve the company**. It takes more time to create but increases your chances of getting an interview.

- **come up with two ideas**. Maybe not great ideas, but that’s okay. What matters is that you’re differentiating yourself from other applicants.

- This is a show vs tell situation. For instance, an idea-first cover letter shows you are a creative thinker. It’s more powerful than saying “I’m a creative thinker.” Also shows you took time to research the company, which is important.

- another r[eal cover letter example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y4Ss23n_wI2DYAiUlkCqt9FLrX6hETVjyQXzBVnF_Mg/edit) (but it's a bit too long )


Step 4. Quickly apply to remote jobs
---

:::success
**Action Step**


- Create a generic cover letter [using mine](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1462awCEaExx_MziP4_TuY-Egb4Ly5sRFZ2uHF2jl5XA/edit) as inspiration.
- Create an Indeed resume (i.e. Indeed profile) and apply to remote jobs that allow you to quick-apply with your Indeed resume.
- Complete your LinkedIn profile ([here is mine](https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/robert-gibb-iv/?challengeId=AQHLSD1GT44mrQAAAXPb3qUACG-4rG33cZPpnBBUf5bLDrp6LcDt-Mv1O7xNbmwvTSE2xQ_vXUwipVdNC4ypDqO7e3WXrAL9RQ&submissionId=fcc416fa-b11d-2a16-5ff1-e248b5be2f5f)) and apply to jobs with the Easy Apply option.
:::

- Don’t add jobs you quick-apply to to your tracking sheet unless you 1) create a custom cover letter and/or 2) receive an interview request from the hiring manager. Not adding every job you quick-apply to to your tracking will save you some time.



Step 5. Apply to remote startup jobs on AngelList
--

:::success
**Action Step**

- Create a free [AngelList](https://angel.co) account and complete your profile using the same text you did for your resume. Then, find and apply to some remote jobs!
